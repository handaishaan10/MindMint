# Welcome to your MindMint

## Project info
MindMint offers non-digital, sensory wellness personalized products and kits — crafted to help people take mindful and screen-free mental breaks.
Each kit is designed for a specific emotion — anxiety, sadness, burnout, panic, or simply “I don’t know what I’m feeling.”

Apart from the individual products, we are offering starter kits and advanced kits. The starter ones help you connect to your body, while the advanced ones are more integrated and come with sensory technology that helps you track your progress regularly.

Our USP: MindMint is the first of its kind to blend ancient grounding techniques with modern sensory tech — delivering holistic, screen-free emotional support that grows with your journey. Whether you’re overwhelmed, numb, or unsure, MindMint meets you where you are — no diagnosis, no judgment, just relief.
